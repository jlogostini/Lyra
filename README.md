# Lyra
Lyra Starter Game is a new sample gameplay project released with UE5. This starter game is being built alongside Unreal Engine development; it will be a living project that will continue to be upgraded in future releases to demonstrate our latest best practices for making games in UE5. While the feature set being released is just a core base, this game is still intended to be an excellent starting point for game developers to create new projects, as well as a hands-on learning resource. Lyra Starter Game will take over the role that ShooterGame served in UE4, but it is much more than a 1:1 replacement: it demonstrates scalability from mobile to high-end PC and cross-play multiplayer using Epic Online Services (EOS), and features a choice of two different game modes: Expanse (team deathmatch) and Convolution (control point). 

The Lyra Starter Game also reveals our new UE5 Mannequins, Manny and Quinn, as playable characters. These Mannequins share the same core skeleton hierarchy as the MetaHumans, with a compatible animation system.
